# Peonias-Jazmines-Pasteleria

From conception to implementation, I led and realized the project using various tools and technologies. I began with design in Figma, where I created the necessary wireframes and prototypes for the user interface. Then, I translated these designs into a React application using Vite as a rapid development environment.

To ensure a smooth and adaptable experience across different devices, I focused on developing CSS styles. In addition to basic functionality, I integrated libraries like Email.js for form management, Slick for implementing a smooth and appealing slider, and Stripe as a payment gateway.

Regarding data management, I chose to simulate a database using array mocks. This allowed me to develop and test the application without relying on a complete database infrastructure.

In summary, the project was a comprehensive effort spanning from initial planning to final implementation, using a combination of user-centered design and agile software development to achieve outstanding results.
